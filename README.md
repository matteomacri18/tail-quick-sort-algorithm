Implementation Tail QuickSort Algorithm - from Steven S. Skenia - The algorithm design manual book

Experiment where to implementation  Tail QuickSort by measuring the running time experimental for inputs of increasing length, with multiple repetitions for
the same length. </br>

Tail QuickSort has one advantage: compilers more ecienti realize that the algorithm is tail recursive and automatically
they eliminate this recursive call, producing an object code that is essentially iterative.
